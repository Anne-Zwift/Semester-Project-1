Brief

Leverage your experience designing and building an HTML web application to form a flexible project plan for your upcoming project examination. Using GitHub Projects, create a Kanban and Gantt style chart to serve as a living project plan that you can use to track and communicate your progress. Although you do not have the exam brief, your plan should still provide a useful structure by specifying each step in the process. Use the Progression Plan spreadsheet to assist with selecting dates for each phase or task.

Process
Create a new public GitHub Projects board with the name `Semester Project 1`.
Use the Team Backlog template to create a Kanban view with the appropriate status columns.
Within your Project page create a new Roadmap view tab.
Within your Roadmap view, create two new Date fields called Start Date and Target Date.
Create a draft task for each step in your project plan with the following details:
Title (A short description of the task)
Description (A detailed description of the task)
Size (How much effort the task will require)
Start Date (When the task should be started)
Target Date (When the task should be completed)
Tips
There should be at minimum 15 discrete tasks in your plan. If you have fewer than this your task definitions may be too broad and should be made more specific. For example "Test Website" could be broken down into "WCAG Testing", "HTML Validation", "Cross Browser Testing", etc.
You may add as many additional fields to your Task items as you require. The instructions above state the minimum fields required. Other useful fields may include "Work Type", such as "Design", "Testing", "HTML" or "CSS", etc. Take some time to play around with Project settings and custom fields.
You may adjust your plan in future when you receive the exam brief, including target dates. This project plan is a guide, not a contract. Without the exam brief, there is a limit to how detailed you can make your plan.
Test that it is possible to view your Project as a Kanban or Roadmap/Gantt view in an incognito window. If you cannot access this in incognito, your teacher won't be able to either.

Delivery
